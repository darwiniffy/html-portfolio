<h1>The Best Movies According to Darwin</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<p>It is difficult to make this list as there are a lot of movies that will make the list. Here are the three movies that I can think of.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>I love this film as it is both funny and sad. Forrest will be taking you to a lot of adventures if you watch this film.</p>
<h3>Arrival</h3>
<p>The reason why this movie made the list as it is one of the most thought-provoking film I have ever seen. I love it for the unconventional storytelling where you are jumping through timelines.</p>
<h3>Green Mile</h3>
<p>This is the one where I cried the most. Green Mile is a very sad film about a falsely accused man. You should definitely watch it.</p>
